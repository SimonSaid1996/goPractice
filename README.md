# goPractice
3 go practice codes inspired from online, just to learn how to write go code

note that below are three small go programs, socket_client and socket_server works together. i didn't create those code myself, those code are inspired from the corresponding web sources listed on the top of the codes. i am only using the code as a way of self-practice and self-learning purpose
